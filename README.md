This is a grid based combat game that I created using xcode. 
In the game, the player is an @ sign and the goal is for the player to move around the grid collecting money signs. 
While they are doing this there are enemies ("!") also moving around, and traps too ("*") which do not move. 
If the player runs into a trap or an enemy then they die, the game ends, and they lose. 
If the player gets all the money, then the game ends, and they win. 

For this project I used primarily pointers and made a strong effort to make sure all of my memory was managed well using RAII.
