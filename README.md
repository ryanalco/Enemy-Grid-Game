# Final-Project

For my final project I created a grid based game using xcode. 
In the game, the player is an @ sign on the grid and the goal is for the player to move around the grid collecting money signs. 
While they are doing this there are enemies which look like exclamation marks ("!") also moving around. 
There are traps too ("*") which do not move. 
If the player runs into a trap or an enemy then they die, the game ends and they lose. 
If the player gets all the money, then the game ends and they win. 

For this project I used a lot of pointers and made a strong effort to make sure all of my memory was managed well using RAII.
